# TIS-assignment
Script takes in a matrix of 1's and 0's as input.
1728 x h, where h is any integer. Matrix is a binary representation of a black and white picture.
Script encodes the binary matrix with huffman's code, calculates the compression ratio and returns
code lengths for black and white run-length values.

izhod - output (matrix presented in row vector)
R - compression ratio
kodBela - matrix of white run-lengths
kodCrna - matrix of black run-lengths
